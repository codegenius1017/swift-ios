# Discover Lyon

This project introduces simple UIKit components in the Swift environment. The theme of the application is presentation of the city of Lyon, France.

The app begins with a tab bar controller, offering the user 3 bar view choices. The first scene is a short introduction of Lyon and demonstrates a scroll feature. The next tab bar item takes the user to a table view of common favourite places in the city, where each table cell is connected to the related activity in another scene. The third tab offers a map view of the city, with annotations for places, current user location information and zoom buttons for scrolling the map. The app has been tested in Xcode 10.1, Swift 4.2 and with iPhone 6.
