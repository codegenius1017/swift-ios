# Book Library App

This is a Swift app that demonstrates the implementation of [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata). It is a personal library app, where the user can make new entries with details about books read and save the data for offline use.

## Swift Topics covered
- Use of Core data to save app user information
- Table view to retrieve and display saved Core Data contents
- Customisation of table cells (by subclassing the cell type)
